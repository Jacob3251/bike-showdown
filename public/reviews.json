    "reviews": "The Filipinos seem to be dazzled by how this two-wheeler performs and appears. Now the reason why I bought this vehicle was the clarity in its claims of power and performance. It gets a no-nonsense look on its face which is true to its inputs that seem to be a little borrowed from its predecessors.",

Starting right from a track-oriented look to its green and black color setting, the Ninja dawns the perfect Ninja attire. Interestingly, the bike is no less than a ninja",

This bike looks bigger and more massive than the Ninja 250. The Ninja ZX-25R has a commanding road presence. It has all-round handsome looks.",

But if you want to turn heads on the street, then bet on the Ninja ZX 25R to do the job. Riding the Ninja was a dream come true",
